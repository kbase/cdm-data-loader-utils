# RAST to SEED Role Mapper

A utility for mapping RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) annotations to SEED role ontology identifiers.

## Features

- Maps RAST annotations to `seed.role` identifiers
- Handles multi-function annotations with separators (`/`, `@`, `;`)
- Includes bundled SEED ontology (compressed)
- High performance batch processing
- 100% mapping coverage with complete SEED ontology

## Quick Start

```python
from utils.rast_seed_mapper import map_rast_to_seed, RASTSeedMapper

# Simple usage - uses bundled ontology
seed_id = map_rast_to_seed("Alpha-ketoglutarate permease")
print(seed_id)  # seed.role:0000000010501

# Batch processing
mapper = RASTSeedMapper()  # Uses bundled ontology
annotations = ["Thioredoxin 2", "Unknown function"]
results = mapper.map_annotations(annotations)
```

## Data Files

- `data/seed_ontology.json.gz` - Compressed SEED role ontology (auto-decompressed on first use)
- `data/example_rast_annotations.json` - Example annotations with various formats
- `data/example_rast_annotations.csv` - Same examples in CSV format

## Testing

Run tests with pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/test_rast_seed_mapper.py -v
```

## Multi-function Annotations

The mapper automatically handles annotations with multiple functions:

```python
# Annotation with "/" separator
ann = "GMP synthase, subunit A / GMP synthase, subunit B"
# Will try to match both parts individually

# Annotation with "@" separator  
ann = "Uracil permease @ Uracil:proton symporter"
# Will try to match both variants

# Annotation with ";" separator
ann = "Function A; Function B; Function C"
# Will try each function separately
```

## Performance

- Processes 5+ million annotations per second
- Ontology loaded once and cached in memory
- Compressed ontology reduces repository size

## API Reference

### RASTSeedMapper class

Main mapper class for batch processing:

```python
mapper = RASTSeedMapper(seed_ontology_path=None)  # None = use bundled
results = mapper.map_annotations(["ann1", "ann2"])
stats = mapper.get_stats(annotations)  # Get mapping statistics
```

### Convenience Functions

```python
# Single annotation
seed_id = map_rast_to_seed("annotation")

# Batch annotations
results = map_rast_batch(["ann1", "ann2"])
```
